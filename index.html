                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”</p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-sm opacity-70">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
